# dead-and-wounded

A number guessing game. The purpose of the game is to guess the random number generated by the computer. 
---
If your guess has the right number in the right position, it registers as +1Dead.
If it has the right number but in the wrong position, it registers as +1Wounded

So if the computer generates a random number 4123 and you guess 2167, it returns 1 dead, 1 wounded.

# How To Play
1. Choose a difficulty level (Easy - 4 numbers, Medium - 5 numbers, Hard - 6 numbers)
2. Guess a random number the same length as the difficulty level chosen
3. Try to figure out the computer`s number
